This is a Sports Analytics Project I am going to perform using IPL data that I got from Kaggle

Data Source :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020

In this Project I have performed basic EDA on the data and tried to answer a few quesions with the help of ths data and reach to some conclusions

The 5 Questions I am answering in this project are

1. Who are the Top 10 Run Scorers
2. Who are the Top Wicket-Taking Bowlers
3. Who are the most Economic Bowlers
4. Who are the Top 10 batsman with Highest Strike Rates
5. Who are the Top 10 Six Hitters


I will also be Visualizing my findings with help of various charts like Bar Chart, Pie Chart,Scatterplot,Line Chart and Lolipop Chart
